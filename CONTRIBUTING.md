# Contributing to cryptocompare-api project

We would love for you to contribute to cryptocompare-api project and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep cryptocompare-api open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/joancaron/cryptocompare-api/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/joancaron/cryptocompare-api/issues) to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/joancaron/cryptocompare-api/pulls) with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/joancaron/cryptocompare-api/issues) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](https://github.com/joancaron/cryptocompare-api/pulls).

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/joancaron/cryptocompare-api/pulls) for an open or closed PR
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
1. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
  Discussing the design up front helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.
1. Fork the repo.
1. Make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

1. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
1. Follow our Coding Rules.
1. Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
1. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows 
  ["Conventional commits" conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). Adherence to these conventions
  is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```
    Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

1. Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

1. In GitHub, send a pull request to `master`.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Re-run the Angular test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* We follow [Microsoft's Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/)
